## Compiling and running
1. Run `make`
2. Run `./project2 <numConsumers>` (we've tried anywhere from 1 consumer to 2000)

## Difficulties
If your input file disagrees with the program for any reason, we've included a folder `working_text` including a few examples of files we used for testing which worked for us.
