## Compiling and running
1. Run `make`
2. For console input, run `./project2 <numConsumers>` (we've tried anywhere from 1 consumer to 2000). Ctrl+D will signal End-of-File.
3. For file input, run `./project2 <numConsumers>  < file_name.txt`.

## Difficulties
If your input file disagrees with the program for any reason, we've included a folder `working_text` including a few examples of files we used for testing which worked for us.
